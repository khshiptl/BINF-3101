# BINF 3101 – Bioinformatics Labs

This repository contains my lab work for **BINF 3101 (Bioinformatics)** at UNC Charlotte.  
It includes analyses and projects covering sequence alignment, BLAST searches, multiple sequence alignments, and phylogenetic tree construction.

## Overview of Labs

| Lab | Topic | Tools/Concepts | Description |
|-----|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Lab 1** | Introduction to Bioinformatics | NCBI, FASTA | Downloaded gene sequences from NCBI and explored sequence file formats. |
| **Lab 2** | Sequence Alignment | Clustal Omega | Performed pairwise and multiple sequence alignments. |
| **Lab 3** | BLAST Search | NCBI BLAST | Identified sequence homology and annotated gene function. |
| **Lab 4** | Multiple Sequence Comparison | MEGA | Compared conserved regions across different species. |
| **Lab 5** | Phylogenetic Analysis | MEGA, IQ-TREE | Built evolutionary trees and analyzed genetic relationships. |
| **Lab 6–8** | Advanced Tree Construction | IQ-TREE, ModelFinder | Conducted model selection and created maximum likelihood trees. |
| **Lab 9** | HXK2 Gene Phylogeny | IQ-TREE | Aligned HXK2 gene sequences and compared phylogenetic trees across species. |
